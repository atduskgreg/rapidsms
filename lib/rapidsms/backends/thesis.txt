 I am working on building a translation application.  The application will plug into RapidSMS and will be capable of provided translations of incoming messages by way of several methods.  I am currently exploring the various methods for provided crowdsourced, professional and machine translation services.  It will definitely include Mechanical Turk, the mechanics of which I am working on now.  It may include Meedan, who uses profession translators, though that is still up in the air as it is unclear exactly how Meedan functions and how they help in this context.  I am also hoping to do some testing on some of the machine translation services like google's.  I am also thinking of some more experimental approaches, possibly a game based translation system akin to the google image labeler.
